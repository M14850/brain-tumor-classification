# brain-tumor-classification
Repo is for brain tumor classification using machine learning algorithms

In this project we used the data from (source: Kaggle) to perform analysis and prediction. the application of machine learning techniques for brain tumor classification has been demonstrated in this project. Four different algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and KNN Classifier were used, and the performance of each algorithm was evaluated using accuracy, recall, and precision metrics

Teechnologies used:

python (pandas, matplotlib, sklearn), jupiter note book

Software required:

Any Operating system, python compiler and jupiter notebook
